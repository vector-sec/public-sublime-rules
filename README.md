# public-sublime-rules

This is my repo for testing Sublime's new public rule feeds functionality. I'll post rules here that I'm working on that I am not confident enough in yet to contribute back to the [Sublime community rules repository](https://github.com/sublime-security/sublime-rules/)

Feedback welcome!
